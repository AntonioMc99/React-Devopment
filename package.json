  "description": "I originally just wanted to polish my last project, but I decided to push myself and take on something a bit tougher. This is a simple, clean URL shortener I built with React and Vite that talks to the Bitly API. You can paste any valid link, get a short one back, copy it in one click, and see your history even after a refresh because I keep everything in localStorage. I added friendly validation, clear loading and error messages, and kept the layout responsive with accessible focus and hover states. To keep my Bitly token safe I send requests through a tiny serverless function at api slash shorten and I set the Bitley environment variable on my host. I ran it locally with npm install and npm run dev and deployed with Vercel. It was a fun way to stretch beyond my last build while keeping the code small and easy to read.",
